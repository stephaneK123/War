<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![product-screenshot](images/20140120-IMG_0301.jpg)

This project is an implementation of the card game "War". Here is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5vT33Vo04s) to understand how the game is played. The War-1 file simulates a full game.

### Built With
  Java 8


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

These 4 files are needed to run the program. All you need to do is have all the files in the same package. The War-1 class can then be compiled and a simulation of the game will start! Enjoy. 

### Prerequisites

All you need is any Java IDE
